# ITGmania-Noteskin-Graphic-Fixes
Fix those oddball graphics!

So I have been working on the noteskins in my ITGMania (https://www.itgmania.com/) to get them as graphically polished as possible. Sort of like a personal challenge that also scratches the itch of wanting to clean up the imperfections. This gave me the idea to plop them on github for everyone's use if they would like to do so as well. I set these up with default names so you can just drag and drop them in the Noteskins>Dance folder and it'll automatically replace the necessary files. But you can also pick and choose which ones you would prefer. None of the things here are essential tweaks as they are all perfectly playable as-is without these. But you can read about them below.

-----Cel-----

-Redrew the hold bottomcaps so they aren't jagged and better match the bodies.

-Fixed the coloration of the active roll bottomcaps as there were very strong mismatches.

-----Cyber-----

-Made all hold graphics tile more invisibly. They're not perfect as the gradients are exceptionally hard to match and make them have the feel of the originals, but it's way less noticeable.

-The same active roll bottomcap fix as Cel as they use the same roll graphics. (Note that this does not fix the bug that causes them to not glow properly. I'm at a loss why it occurs because it uses the exact same active bottomcap code as Cel and Metal but Cel and Metal work fine.)

-----Enchantment-----

-Fixed the mines so they aren't invading each other's space so you no longer see pieces of others flop in and cleaned up the graphical cutoff where bits were rotated outside the boundary of the image. There was also some odd buggy misalignment on a few frames that I cleaned up.

-Adjusted some bits of the active roll bottomcap to better match colors.

-----Metal-----

-Better matched the colors of the hold bottomcaps.

-The same active roll bottomcap fix as Cel as they use the same roll graphics.
